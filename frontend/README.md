# frontend

This project was bootstrapped manually to mirror the default Vite + React template.
It now uses Tailwind CSS via PostCSS for styling.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in development mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production.

### `npm run preview`
Preview the production build locally.

### `npm run lint`
Runs ESLint across the project.

### Styling
Tailwind configuration lives in `tailwind.config.js`, with PostCSS plugins defined
in `postcss.config.js`. Ensure dependencies are installed with `npm install`
before running the dev server.
